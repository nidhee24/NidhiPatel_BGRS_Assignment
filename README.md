# Nidhi Patel React BGRS Assessment

## Coding
- [x] First of all to do programming in react and redux I installed following dependencies:
    npm install redux
    npm install react-redux
    npm install redux-thunk
- [x] Requirement was to create a dropdown which to be fetch from swapi so I created action and reducer for drop down data which is under component/store folder.
- [x] then I created component Characters.js to call the action and reducer which I successfully able to execute.
- [x] Used lodash for getting index of character and films objects in Characters.js
- [x] Used material-ui for designing components
- [x] Used dialog box for drop down.

## Learning curves and challenges
- [x] From this assignment I learned lodash which was totally new for me and I do used react practically was implementing redux was first time for me in such projects and thus this assignment gave me an opportunity to enhance my skills in redux. Initially, I was facing problems because API was little confusing but after involving more in api I came to know how to implement.
